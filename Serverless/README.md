When you create an application or a project, to make it professional grade, you need to keep a few things in mind. Is the application scalable when demand would fluctuate? Is it flexible in terms of deployment and easy to integrate new features? Will it be cost effective compared to the traditional server based method of deployment? And most important one, Would you rather focus on writing the code or managing the underlying infrastructure?
