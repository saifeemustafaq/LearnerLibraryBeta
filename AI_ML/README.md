# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

According to Columbia University, "artificial intelligence refers to the general ability of computers to emulate human thought and perform tasks in real-world environments, while machine learning refers to the technologies and algorithms that enable systems to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve themselves through experience and data." [source](https://ai.engineering.columbia.edu/ai-vs-machine-learning/).
