# Containers and Kubernetes

As a student when you are working on long term projects, you will need to learn about containers. Containers will make it easier to deploy your applications which are complex in nature. Containers is becoming increasingly popular in the cloud development field as they provide isolated environment hence testing and reproducing becomes much easier and save you time.
